# Set-up

  ### Do not change the name of these files

The names stored in the files are completely fictional except my own and sroe no personal infromation

# Running the files

You can now run the python files named "Pre_relese_task1&3" and "Pre_release_task2"/
Task 1&3 are used for inputing data.
Task 2 is for reading data from task 1.
The CSV files can be editted in any spreadsheet viewer and will not effect the programs.
This creates a system more simmilar to an admin interface.
